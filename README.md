# PocketCooker
This prog is able to work with recipe book.

PocketCooker Project:
I implemented an application for storing recipes with work through the command line.
Each recipe has a unique name and ID, we will consider it as unique recipe identifiers.
The application can:
1) Before starting the program, create an array of recipes and load the data from the RecipeBook.csv file there:
2) Create a recipe upon request from the command line, add to the recipe array and write to the RecipeBook.csv file, give it an ID automatically
3) Delete the recipe on request from the command line and from the RecipeBook.csv file
4) Get a prescription by his name
5) Delete all recipes from the RecipeBook.csv file
6) Edit the recipe, its ingredients or preparation with the recording of new data in the RecipeBook.csv file
7) Search by ingredients, display the most relevant, top 3, unknown ingredients, add to a separate file Not_knowing_words.txt
8) Display all recipes on the screen from the array of all recipes RecipeArray
9) Create recursively invoked menus with suggestions of available methods
10) Add recipes to your favorite FavoriteRecipes.csv file
11) Delete recipes from FavoriteRecipes.csv favorite file
12) Display all recipes on the screen from the file of favorite recipes FavoriteRecipes.csv
13) Delete all recipes from your favorite FavoriteRecipes.csv recipes
